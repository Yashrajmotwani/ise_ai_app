Generate a Python script that scrapes a Wikipedia page containing a list of IITs.
 The script should use requests to fetch the page content and BeautifulSoup to extract 
 IIT details from a table. It should clean the extracted text, remove reference numbers, 
 and retrieve each IIT's logo URL. Finally, it should save the data in JSON format.
