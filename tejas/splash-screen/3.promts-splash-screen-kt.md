```
I want to create a splash screen for my Android app that displays for
 a few seconds before moving to the main screen. How can I do this?
```
```
My splash screen sometimes stays stuck and doesn’t transition to the next
 screen. What could be wrong?
```
```
I want my splash screen to look modern and smooth, with full edge-to-edge support. 
How do I do that?
```
```
How can I make sure my splash screen doesn’t reappear when I press the back button after
 opening the main screen?
```
```
Right now, my splash screen disappears too fast. How can I change the delay before transitioning?
```
