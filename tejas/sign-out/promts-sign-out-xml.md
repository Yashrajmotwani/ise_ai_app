```
I want to create a simple logout screen in Android using XML. It should have a message
 asking if the user wants to log out and a button to confirm logout. Can you help me design the layout?
```
```
My logout button is not properly centered on the screen. It looks off in different screen 
sizes. How can I ensure it stays centered?
```

```
I want to make sure my logout button has a custom background and looks visually appealing.
 How can I apply a drawable background to it?
