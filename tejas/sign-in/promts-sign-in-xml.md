```
Generate an XML layout for an Android Sign-In screen. The UI should have a large title text,
 a Google Sign-In button, and a footer message at the bottom. Use a dark background and a gold
 border for the title.
```

```
Modify the Google Sign-In button to have rounded corners, elevation for a 3D effect, and
 appropriate padding. Make sure the button is centered on the screen.
```

```
Ensure that the text styles look modern. Use a sans-serif font for the title, a lighter
 font for subtext, and a contrasting color scheme for good readability.
```
```
Add proper constraint layout properties so that the UI adapts well to different screen sizes.
 The title should always stay near the top, the button should be centered, and the footer should stick to the bottom.
```
```
The footer text is not properly aligned at the bottom on different screen sizes. Fix the
 layout constraints to ensure it stays at the bottom without overlapping other elements.
```

```
The Google Sign-In button looks too small on some devices. Adjust the padding, width, 
and height to make it look consistent across different screen densities.
```
