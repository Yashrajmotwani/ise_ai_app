```
Generate a Kotlin class for Android that extends BroadcastReceiver to handle geofence transitions. The class should receive geofence transition events, check for errors, and log transition details. It should also trigger a notification when the user enters a geofenced area.
```
```
Modify the generated geofence receiver code to include detailed logging. Each step, such as error detection, transition type, and geofence triggering, should be logged using Log.d(). Ensure that the logs clearly indicate what is happening at each stage
```
```
Enhance the geofence receiver to send a notification when a geofence entry transition occurs. The notification should include the name of the geofence (extracted from requestId) and open a specific activity (MapActivity) when clicked
```
```
Improve the error-handling mechanism in the geofence receiver. If an error occurs while processing geofence events, log a meaningful error message using GeofenceStatusCodes.getStatusCodeString(). Ensure that the app does not crash and can continue handling valid geofence events
```
